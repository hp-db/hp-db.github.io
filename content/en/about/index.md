## About this site

Welcome to our Hieratische Paläographie DB!

This is a retrieval system for hieratic scripts; it uses IIIF format images (owned by the Asian Research Library of the University of Tokyo) of Georg Möller's Hieratische Paläographie (1909–36).

We hope this platform is useful for everyone who has an interest in Hieratic scripts.
